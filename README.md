# MinimalistDriver
 This repository hosts a minimalist, yet functional device driver designed for educational and illustrative purposes.

* What is a driver? What function does it perform?
* How does a driver differ from conventional software?
* What type of interface should the driver provide?

A driver is a specialized software component that facilitates communication between a computer's operating system (OS) and a hardware device. Is a specialized software component designed to enable communication between the operating system and hardware devices. Users in a UNIX system interact with drivers through system calls, device files, and command-line utilities. The transparent handling of hardware devices by drivers and the abstraction provided by device files contribute to a standardized and consistent user experience when working with diverse hardware components in a UNIX environment. The type of interface that a driver should provide depends on the nature of the hardware it is designed to support and the requirements of the operating system and should offer interfaces like Kernel, Device File, Control, API, and Event Notification for effective interaction with hardware.
