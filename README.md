# MinimalistDriver
 This repository hosts a minimalist, yet functional device driver designed for educational and illustrative purposes.

* What is a driver? What function does it perform?
* How does a driver differ from conventional software?
* What type of interface should the driver provide?

A driver is a specialized software component that facilitates communication between a computer's operating system (OS) and a hardware device. Is a specialized software component designed to enable communication between the operating system and hardware devices. Users in a UNIX system interact with drivers through system calls, device files, and command-line utilities. The transparent handling of hardware devices by drivers and the abstraction provided by device files contribute to a standardized and consistent user experience when working with diverse hardware components in a UNIX environment. 

The type of interface that a driver should provide depends on the nature of the hardware it is designed to support and the requirements of the operating system. Generally, drivers offer one or more of the following types of interfaces:

Kernel Interface:

Purpose: Drivers often provide a kernel interface to interact with the operating system's kernel. This interface allows the driver to register itself, receive system calls, and communicate with other kernel components.
Implementation: The kernel interface is implemented through functions and data structures that adhere to the kernel's specifications.
Device File Interface:

Purpose: Many drivers in UNIX-like systems expose a device file interface under the /dev directory. This allows user-level applications to communicate with the driver using standard file operations like reading and writing.
Implementation: Device files are created by the driver during initialization, and user-space programs interact with them as if they were regular files.
Control and Configuration Interface:

Purpose: Some drivers provide a control and configuration interface for users and system administrators to manage device settings. This can include functionalities such as enabling/disabling features, adjusting parameters, or querying device status.
Implementation: Control interfaces may involve command-line utilities, system calls, or configuration files.
Application Programming Interface (API):

Purpose: Drivers may expose an API for application developers to access device functionalities at a higher level. This is common in scenarios where multiple applications may need to interact with the same device.
Implementation: APIs are defined by the driver and documented for application developers. They provide a set of functions or procedures that applications can use to communicate with the driver.
Event Notification Interface:

Purpose: Some drivers offer interfaces to notify the system or applications about specific events or changes in device status. This is crucial for real-time or event-driven applications.
Implementation: Events can be communicated through callbacks, signals, or other mechanisms, allowing interested parties to respond to changes in real-time.
