# MinimalistDriver
 This repository hosts a minimalist, yet functional device driver designed for educational and illustrative purposes.

* What is a driver? What function does it perform?
* How does a driver differ from conventional software?
* What type of interface should the driver provide?

A driver is a specialized software component that facilitates communication between a computer's operating system (OS) and a hardware device. Is a specialized software component designed to enable communication between the operating system and hardware devices. Users in a UNIX system interact with drivers through system calls, device files and command-line utilities. The transparent handling of hardware devices by drivers and the abstraction provided by device files contribute to a standardized and consistent user experience when working with diverse hardware components in a UNIX environment. The type of interface that a driver should provide depends on the nature of the hardware like Device File, Control, API, and Event Notification for effective interaction with hardware.

# Prepare a driver

For a driver to be useful, users must access it. In Linux, this is done through the file system: devices (physical or virtual) appear as files in the /dev directory. If we run ls /dev -l, we can see something like:
